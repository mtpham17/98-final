STAT 98 Final Project: Cluster Analysis on Different COVID-19 Immigration Policies

This paper explores the clusterings of countries and territories, by their immigration policies in the wake of COVID-19. We use K-means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) to create the clusters, with the gap statistic and cophenetic correlation to tune the hyperparameters required for each. We analyze the results of the clustering by attempting to find critical features of the ``average"  policy of each cluster. In addition, we use demographic variables, such as GDP, to understand trends among countries of similar immigration policies. We see very different results for between K-means and HAC. Moreover, we generally do not see clear patterns across these clusters, though there are some interesting findings at the smaller scale.
